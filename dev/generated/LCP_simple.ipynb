    "This notebook provides an expansion of lecture notes and Julia code to solve optimal stopping\n",
    "problems numerically as a [Differential Variational Inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_variational_inequality) (DVI).  For more, see\n",

    "\n",
    "## A Univariate Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume the following\n",
    "\n",
    "* A stochastic process $x$, with [infinitesimal generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal_generator_(stochastic_processes)) $\\mathcal{L}_x$\n",
    "  and boundary conditions.  (e.g. the infinitesimal generator for Brownian motion with drift $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma$ is\n",
    "  $\\mathcal{L}_x \\equiv \\mu \\partial_x + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}\\partial_{xx}$.)\n",
    "* Boundary conditions for the $x$ stochastic process (e.g., reflecting barriers at some minimum and maximum.)\n",
    "* Flow payoffs $u(x)$ discounted at rate $\\rho > 0$.\n",
    "* Stopping payoff $S(x)$ which gives the value of stopping at state $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The control problem is: choose when to stop the process and gain the payoff $S(x)$.  If there are only two regions, then this becomes the choice of a stopping threshold $\\hat{x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classical Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"classical\" formulation (e.g., [Stokey's \"The Economics of Inaction\"](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/8766.html)) of this problem is as a free-boundary problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, in a stationary environment, the Bellman equation within the interior (continuation) region is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  \\rho v(x) = u(x) + \\mathcal{L}_x v(x)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a new operator and rewrite,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  \\mathcal{L} v(x) &= u(x)\\label{eq:bellman}\\\\\n",
    "  \\mathcal{L} &\\equiv \\rho - \\mathcal{L}_x\\label{eq:L-op}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with boundary conditions from the stochastic process (e.g., a reflecting barrier at an $x_{\\min}$ and another at some $x_{\\max}$, or a transversality condition.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In special cases with sufficient monotonicity, there is a single stopping region, defined by a threshold at $\\hat{x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this, the necessary conditions for optimality are the value matching condition\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  v(\\hat{x}) = S(\\hat{x})\\label{eq:vm}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the smooth pasting condition\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  \\partial_x v(\\hat{x}) = 0\\label{eq:sp}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These conditions are necessary for optimality for any free-boundary problem.  Typically, you would solve $\\eqref{eq:bellman}, \\eqref{eq:vm},\\eqref{eq:sp},$ to find a value function $v(x)$ and a stopping threshold $\\hat{x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this approach can be analytically tractable, it is inconvenient for numerical solutions if: (1) the equations cannot be solved in closed form; (2) there are multiple stopping regions; or (3) the dimension increases, leading to complicated stopping regions separated by non-linear manifolds.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HJB Variational Inequality\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in [Ben Moll's notes](http://www.princeton.edu/~moll/HACTproject/option_simple.pdf), the [DVI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_variational_inequality) form of the above problem is to solve\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  0 = \\min\\{\\mathcal{L} v(x) - u(x), v(x) - S(x)\\}\\label{eq:DVI}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for $v(x)$.  A few important notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The $\\mathcal{L} v(x) - u(x)$ term is just the Bellman equation $\\eqref{eq:bellman}$ if it is binding and $=0$.\n",
    "* The $v(x) - S(x)$ term is the value matching condition in $\\eqref{eq:vm}$ if it is binding and $=0$.\n",
    "* You are **not directly solving for the boundaries** of the stopping regions (i.e., there is no $\\hat{x}$ in the system.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a solution for $v(x)$, $\\eqref{eq:DVI}$ determines which regime a particular $x$ is in.  Those boundaries can be used to determine where an $\\hat{x}$ occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, you can prove that at any of those points, a solution to $\\eqref{eq:DVI}$ implies the smooth-pasting condition $\\eqref{eq:sp}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Numerical Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the equation numerically, we first discretize the state-space, value function, and operators with  upwind finite difference methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abusing notation, define\n",
    "* The grid of $M$ values in the domain, $x \\equiv \\{x_1, x_2, \\ldots x_M\\}$.\n",
    "* Vectors for the values of functions at grid points: $v \\equiv \\{v(x_m)\\}_{m=1}^M$ and $S \\equiv \\{S(x_m)\\}_{m=1}^M$.\n",
    "* The matrix $L \\in \\mathbb{R}^{M \\times M}$ as the discretization of the $\\mathcal{L}$ in $\\eqref{eq:L-op}$, such that any boundary conditions on the stochastic process are fulfilled (i.e. properties of the $x$ such as reflecting barriers.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: See the [document](https://quantecon.github.io/SimpleDifferentialOperators.jl/dev/generated/discretized-differential-operator-derivation.pdf) in this repository for notes on the discretization of the $\\mathcal{L}$ to form the $L$ operator - subject to various boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these definitions, the DVI in $\\eqref{eq:DVI}$ becomes the variational inequality\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve $\\eqref{eq:VI}$ for the $v\\in\\mathbb{R}^M$ vector, we can express it as a [linear complementarity problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_complementarity_problem) (or LCP).\n",
