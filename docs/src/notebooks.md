Notebooks
==============

We prepared a gallery of notebooks to showcase the applicability of the package to different economic problems.

* [Kolmogorov forward equations](../generated/KFE.html). You can download the notebook [here](../generated/KFE.ipynb).

* [Optimal Stopping Problems](../generated/LCP_simple.html). You can download the notebook [here](../generated/LCP_simple.ipynb).

* [Optimal Stopping Problems with Jump Diffusion](../generated/LCP_jump_diffusion.html). You can download the notebook [here](../generated/LCP_jump_diffusion.ipynb).

* [Computational Appendix: Optimal Stopping Problems](../generated/LCP_advanced.html). You can download the notebook [here](../generated/LCP_advanced.ipynb). This notebook presents solution to the problem in Julia, using a number of solvers and modeling tools.
